GuoFeng Webnovel is a discourse-level and multilingual corpus of web fiction in three directions: **Chinese→English**, **Chinese→German**, **Chinese→Russian**.
Specifically,

- **GuoFeng Webnovel Corpus v1:** a in-domain, discourse-level and human-translated training dataset with sentence-level alignment for Chinese→English.
- **GuoFeng Webnovel Corpus v2:** two in-domain and discourse-level training dataset for Chinese→German and Chinese→Russian.

## Description (GuoFeng Webnovel Corpus)

</div>

💌 The web novels are originally written in Chinese by novel writers and then translated into English by professional translators. As shown in Figure 2, we processed the data using automatic and manual methods:
1. align Chinese books with their English versions by title information;
2. In each book, align Chinese-English chapters according to Chapter ID numbers;
3. Build an MT-based sentence aligner to generate parallel sentences;
4. ask human annotators to check and revise the alignment errors.

💡 Note that:
1. some sentences may have no aligned translations because human translators translate novels in a document way;
2. we keep all document-level information such as continuous chapters and sentences.

### Download  
We release 22,567 continuous chapters from 179 web novels, covering 14 genres such as fantasy science and romance. The data statistics are listed in Table 1.

### Data Format
Taking "train.en" for exaple, the data format is shown as follows: <font color=red> &lt;BOOK id=""&gt; &lt;/BOOK&gt; </font> indicates a book boundary, which contains a number of continous chapters with the tag <font color=blue> \<CHAPTER id=""\> \</CHAPTER\></font>. The contents are splited into sentences and manually aligned to Chinese sentences in "train.zh".

<BOOK id="100-jdxx">
<CHAPTER id="jdxx_0001">
Chapter 1 Make Your Choice, Youth
"Implode reality, pulverize thy spirit. By banishing this world, comply with the blood pact, I will summon forth thee, O' young Demon King!"
At a park during sunset, a childlike, handsome youth placed his left hand on his chest, while his right hand was stretched out with his fingers wide open, as though he was about to release something amazing from his palm. He looked serious and solemn.

## Data Description (GuoFeng Webnovel Corpus V2)


## Pretrained Models
We provide three types of in-domain pretrained models (same as last year) and large language models (new in this year):

| Version | Layer | Hidden Size | Vocab | Continuous Train |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| [Chinese-Llama-2-7B](https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/Chinese-Llama-2) | 32 | 4096 | 32000 | Chinese and English literary texts (115B tokens) |
| [RoBERTa](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1qvukp4cmhp36t4/AABKjGLa9rmDs-NQkA0zWHoKa?Submit=Click+here+to+download+the+models) | base | 12 enc | 768 | 21128 |
| Chinese literary text (84B tokens) | mBARTCC25 | 12 enc + 12 dec | 1024 | 250000 |

## Evaluation 

- 🤖 Automatic Evaluation: To evaluate the performance of the well-trained models, we will report multiple evaluation metrics, including d-BLEU (document-level sacreBLEU), d-COMET (document-level COMET) to measure the overall accuracy and fluency of the translations.

- 👩‍🏫 Human Evaluation: Besides, we provide professional translators to assess the translations based on more subjective criteria, such as the preservation of literary style and the overall coherence and cohesiveness of the translated texts. Based on our experience with this project, we designed a fine-grained error typology and marking MQM criteria for literary MT.

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A/B Testing: Acknowledging the concern that there is no single, universally preferred translation for literary texts, we ask human readers or LLMs to select their preferred contents in practical application scenarios.
